***************************************************************      BASICS      ***************************************************************

💼 1. What is an ERP System?
Imagine a big shop like Amazon.

It has:

People ordering things (Customers)

People buying goods to keep in stock (Procurement)

People creating bills (Invoices)

People collecting money (Sales)

People paying suppliers (Finance)

To manage this, they use a big software called ERP (like SAP). ERP stores all actions in tables.

🧱 2. Tables in ERP (SAP)
Tables are like Excel sheets where everything is recorded.

Example:
Table	What's inside
EKKO	Purchase order info
VBAK	Sales order info
BKPF	Invoice/billing document
LIPS	Delivery info
MKPF	Goods receipt

But just tables are boring. You need to know what happened, when, and to what.

🧠 3. What is an Object?
An object is a thing the business cares about and tracks.

Think of objects like characters in a story:

🧾 PO (Purchase Order)

🧑 Vendor

🧍 Customer

💰 Invoice

📦 Delivery

📄 Sales Order

You want to know what happened to these objects over time.

🎬 4. What is an Event?
An event is something that happens to an object.

Think of events like actions in the story:

PO Created

Goods Received

Invoice Posted

Payment Made

Sales Order Created

Delivery Done

Each event has:

What happened (Activity)

When it happened (Timestamp)

What it happened to (Object)

🔁 5. Why Relationships Matter
Relationships tell us how objects are connected.

Let’s say:

One PO (Purchase Order) has many items. ✅ That’s 1 to many (1:M)

One Vendor sends multiple invoices. ✅ That’s 1:M

One Invoice could pay for many POs (rare). ❗ That’s many to many (M:N)

Without relationships, we can’t know which invoice belongs to which PO or vendor.

🛒 6. P2P Example (Procure to Pay)
🎯 Goal: Company buys a laptop from Vendor
👥 Objects:
PO123 (Purchase Order)

GR001 (Goods Receipt)

INV001 (Invoice)

VendorX

🎥 Events:
PO Created for laptop (PO123)

Goods Received (GR001)

Invoice Posted (INV001)

Payment Made

🧩 Tables & Relationships:
Table	Object	Event	Related To	Relationship
EKKO	PO	PO Created	Vendor (LIFNR)	1:1
EKPO	PO Item	-	PO (EKKO)	1:M
MKPF	GR	Goods Received	PO (EBELN)	1:M
RSEG	Invoice Item	Invoice Posted	PO (EBELN)	1:M
BKPF	Invoice	Payment Made	Vendor (LIFNR)	1:1

💰 7. O2C Example (Order to Cash)
🎯 Goal: Customer orders a phone from your company
👥 Objects:
SO101 (Sales Order)

DL001 (Delivery)

INV999 (Invoice)

CustomerA

🎥 Events:
Sales Order Created (SO101)

Delivery Done (DL001)

Invoice Generated (INV999)

Payment Received

🧩 Tables & Relationships:
Table	Object	Event	Related To	Relationship
VBAK	Sales Order	Order Created	Customer (KUNNR)	1:1
VBAP	Order Item	-	Sales Order (VBAK)	1:M
LIKP	Delivery	Delivery Created	Sales Order (VBELN)	1:M
VBRK	Billing	Invoice Created	Sales Order or Delivery	1:M
KNA1	Customer	Payment Received	Billing (VBRK)	1:M

🔗 8. Which Relationship to Use?
Use the one that makes sense based on the data connection:

Type	When to use	Example
1:1	One thing matches exactly one thing	One invoice = one vendor
1:M	One thing has many related things	One PO = many PO items
M:N	Many things relate to many others	One invoice pays many POs (rare)

In OCPM, all of them are allowed! That’s the beauty.

You just link each event to all related objects.

🧾 9. What OCPM Event Log Looks Like
OCPM doesn’t force you to pick just one object like CCPM.
Instead, every event can be linked to many objects.

Event ID	Activity	Timestamp	Object Type	Object ID
E1	PO Created	2024-01-01	PO	PO123
E1	PO Created	2024-01-01	Vendor	VEND01
E2	Invoice Posted	2024-01-05	Invoice	INV001
E2	Invoice Posted	2024-01-05	PO	PO123
E2	Invoice Posted	2024-01-05	Vendor	VEND01

This lets you analyze:

How many POs were invoiced late?

Which vendors send many invoices but don’t get paid?

📌 10. Summary
Concept	Meaning	Child-like Explanation
Object	A business item	Like a character in a story (PO, Vendor, Invoice)
Event	Something that happens	Like an action in the story (PO created, Payment)
Relationship	How objects connect	Like "PO belongs to Vendor", "PO has items"
1:1	One to One	One student has one ID card
1:M	One to Many	One mom has many kids
M:N	Many to Many	Many students join many clubs
OCPM	Tracks all objects and events	Like writing a story with all characters and scenes
